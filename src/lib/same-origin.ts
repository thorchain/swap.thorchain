 * Same-origin only. `Sec-Fetch-Site` is a forbidden header name, so JavaScript

 * send any header it likes; the rate limit is the brake for those.
 *
 * The client builds its URL from `window.location.origin`, so a real request is
 * same-origin whichever host serves the app -- swap.thorchain.org, a tcy./bond./
 * pool. subdomain, or localhost in dev -- and no host allowlist is needed.
